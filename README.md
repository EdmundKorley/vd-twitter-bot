Visual Decolonization Twitter bot :fist:
=============

### As of now, the Visual Decolonization Twitter bot re-streams media-rich Tweets from the Twitter Streaming API with specific timely hashtags, that are now manually updated. The end goal is a stream of pictures, videos, vines, and other media that is delivered from people on the ground and independent of traditional news sources. Network analysis and NLP are key here.

To-do:

- [ ] Neural net for classifying shitposters.
- [ ] Net for building 'trusted' network of protesters.
- [ ] Conversation inteface for nationwide protest trends.
